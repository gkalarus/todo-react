# todo-react
A to-do application made using React.js and Scss. After adding a tasks, the user has the possibility to remove each of them separately from the list. Each element of the list can be marked as 'done' and by using the 'remove finished tasks' button all of the completed tasks can be deleted from the list.

A simple validation has been added:
1) to add a new task, the input field must not be empty
2) it is not possible to enter two identical tasks
